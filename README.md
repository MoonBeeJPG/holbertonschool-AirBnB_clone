# AirBnB clone
### Welcome to our AirBnB clone project!
![HBNB](https://github.com/Titania792/pictures-for-projects/blob/master/hbnb.png)
In this occasion we have to deploy in our own server a simple copy of the AirBnB website to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

### What’s a command interpreter?
Do you know about the Shell? Well this is exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
-   Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
-   Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
-   Update attributes of an object
-   Destroy an object

To Iniciate our command interpreter you must have to execute our file called console.py with _"python3"_ after that you would see Holberton's prompt _"(hbnb) "_  and from that point you would be inside our console. Here you can execute differents customized commands, to know which ones are able and how do they work you can type the command _"help"_ to show all commands or help followed with one of the options to know how it works  _"help [command]"_.
